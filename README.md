# Installation
You can create a .env if you'd like with PORT and MONGODB_URL variables, but if you'd like to run this locally you can clone the repo and not worry about the .env, there are defaults provided in the code.

Once everything is downloaded please navigate to the top level of the project, where the outermost package.json file is, and run an "npm i"

# Usage
Once everything is installed, all you need to run is "npm develop" if you'd like to run this locally.
Otherwise, you can visit the deployed link.
